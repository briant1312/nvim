# Neovim config
 This is my current neovim setup. I am making this README so that I remember everything that needs to be done to set this up in the
 future. The base of this configuration was done using kickstart.nvim which can be found [here](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

## How to setup
- Clone this repo in the USER_PROFILE/.config directory on your machine
- Open nvim in terminal and let it install all plugins
- You can install LSP's using the :Mason command in nvim and selecting i on the LSP that you want to install
- You will have to install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation) to get the full functionality of telescope
- You may have to install [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) to get icons inside of neotree
